High-Level LLM programs

More attention should be paid to what can we build using the models
    Use them in modular ways, rather than an end-to-end system
        like a processor

"BookClub" - a platform for team building bookclubs
    want summarization of the book - one "spark" for each chapter
        wanted to use LLMs to make it easier to curate these - clients choose which books
    
    task:
        input: a full nonfiction book
        output: generate a "path"
            "path": list of 10-15 sparks
            Spark (a concept from the book): list of 5-7 slides
            Each slide (concept, anecdote, note, etc) : a few lines of code
