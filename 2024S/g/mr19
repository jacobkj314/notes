Guest Talks Discussion

Utah AI Law (Just passed)

  Ai governance 
    several efforts under way across the world: EU AI law, OSTP's Blueprint for AI Bill or Right, NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, etc
    General Themes: Effective, safe, and secure systems; Protections against discriminations ; Transparent/accountable systems; maintain data privacy; human alternatives if needed
    Socialtechnical questions, standards organizations

  Artificial Intelligence Policy Act SB0149
    Establishes the "Learning Laboratory Program" to assess AI technoligies, risks, policy implication
      -a new artificial intelligence analysis and research parogram
      -a sandbox for evaluating AI tech (like emissions test or cookies box

      How it works:
        AI corp wants to participate in the learning laboratory to deploy in UT
          (it can choose to not participate)
        Its technology is evaluated by the laboratory
          if approved, it will enjoy regulatory mitigations (any system that has been approved will have a cap on how liable it will be)

        How to evaluate:
          should evaluate Risk Assessment and Management
            -do the consumer benefits of the technology outweigh risks?
            -is there a plan to mitigate risks 
            -etc

        Participants
          -may enjoy potential regulatory mitigations (reduced fines)
          -scope limit on the use of AI such as # and type of users, geographic limitations
          -will be asked to implement safeguards

    Goals:
      investigate the risks benefits of AI
      evaluate the effectiveness of regulations on AI
      new unit in the department of commerce manages the learning laboratory program
        select the areas of AI applications

    Transparency about AI interactions:
      businesses regulated by consumer protection division MUST disclose AI use when you ask
      Regulated professions (like doctors or lawyers)
        Can't use AI to replace themselves completely
        Must disclose AI use when providing services
      Liability for undisclosed use of AI that violates consumer protection laws

    "No Escape" Clause: the following statements won't shield you from legal trouble:
      "The AI made the bad statement."
      "The AI did the wrong thing."
      "The AI helped break the law"
      i.e. You're responsible for your AI deployments

    Sometimes the technology may not be ready:
      ProPublica COMPASS recidivism
      Banjo 
      Face Recognition (often tags the wrong person)

  "Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights" Whitehouse OSTP

  Opportunnities for AI research
    questions related to low data, low compute, energy efficient, privacy

  Interesting first step, 
  what protections are offered? Who does it protect
  Who monitiors the state use of AI? Who monitors the learning laboratory?
  Copyright, plagiarism, etc.?
