NEURAL NETWORKS

Introduction:

What if we want to train non-linear classifiers? Where do the features come from?


  Linear Threshold units:
    sgn(w dot x + b)

    what if each feature were the output from another classifier?


"Neurons":
  accepts a collection of inputs (a vector x) and produces output by:
    1 apply a dot product with weights w and adding a bias b
    2 applyl a (possibly non-linear) transformation called an activation



A function that converts inputs to outputs defined by a directed acyclic graph
  Nodes are organized in layers corresponding to "neurons"
  Edges carry output of one nuerone to another, associated with weights

To define a neural network, we need to specify:
  the structure of the graph, how many nodes, connectivity (the architecture of the network)
  the activation fuction and the weights for each node/edge

Any continuous function can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using one hidden layer of sigmoid units
Two layer threshold network can express any Boolean function

VC dimension of threhshold network with E edges = O(|E| log |E|)
VC dimension of sigmoid networks with V nodes and E edges O(|V|^2 |E|^2) Omega(|E|^2)
