LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Tergeted Instruction Tuning
https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04333
    You don't need an extensive instruction fine tuning phase
    Carefully select a good data mixture

    How to select high-quality examples?
    
    Given a handful of examples embodying a specific capability, how can we effectively select relevant fine tuning data instances?
        Select influential examples

        Use LORA to train on the whole dataset
        track the optimizer states
