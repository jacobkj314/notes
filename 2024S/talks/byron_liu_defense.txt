Dating Greek Documents with Vision Transformers

Intro:
  lingua franca of the mediterannean
  date/time impormation can be lost if the document has been moved, damages, etc
  handwriting+spelling analysis can be used for some 

Previous work
  Ithaca (Assael) march 2022 - a tool for recovering greek texts
  takes regularized greek characters
  trained on 180K samples

  Pavlopoulus 2023 - 
   also based on character inputs

  NONE DATED GREEK DOCUMENTS USING IMAGE INPUTS

Dataset:
  Collected from Berliner Papyrusdatenbank berlpap.smb.museum
  contains examples of texts written on papyrus, ostracon (pottery fragments) and wood
  300BC to 800 AD
  labeled each image with a century based on the midpoint of the range on the item

  multimodal distribution, most documents written around 100AD

Vision Transformer (2020)
  pretrained on IMageNet21K

Results:
  Trained for 10 Epocs
  most common baseline has accuracy of 39%

  After tuning for 10 epochs, accuracy went to 51%, Fscore went from 5% to 43%s
  Began to overfit training data after about 4 epochs
