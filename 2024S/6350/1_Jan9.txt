Machine Learning

What is ML?

Badges game
    ACML 1994
        converence badges were labeled + or -
        output of a function depending on only the attendee's name
            only Haym Hirsh knew the function
    Attendees were tasked to look at all labels and find the hidden function

    Many possible functions but difficult to tell if it is the intended function


1959 first "Machine Learning" written
    "Some studies in Machine Learning using the Game of Checkers" Arthur Samuel 1959
    "Programming computers to learn from experience should eventually eliminate the need for much programming effort"
    "As a result of these experiments one can say with some certainty such learning schemes may eventually be economically feasible as applied to real-life problems"
    Talks about the difference between rote learning and generalization
Herbert Simon (1983) - only person to win nobel prize and turing award
    "Learning denotes changes in the system that are adaptive in the sense that they enable the system to do the task or tasks drawn from the same population more effectively the next time"

Tom Mitchel 1997
    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performace at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."



Learning is generalization
Statistics want to describe data, vs ML wants to predict


Machine Learning is ~~the future~~ here today
    Gives a system the ability to perform a task in a situation which has never been encounterd before
        new way to think about programming
        programs that can acquire new capabilities
    Learning allows programs to interact more robustly with messy data
    You are already using ML-based applications


Related Fields:
    AI - computers that are as intelligent as humans
    CS/Math - formalizing and understanding learning mathematically, using ideas from probability and statistics, linear algebra, theory of computation, mathematical optimization
    Philosophy/cognitive psychology/neuroscience/linguistics
    Many many application areas



Overview of the course:

main question: what is learning
    different formal answers to this problem and what they give using
Different models, learning protocols, effectively

Models:
    decision trees
    linear classifiers and regressors
    non-linear classifiers, NNs and kernels (time permitting)
    ensembles
Protocols:
    Supervised (teacher + learner)
    Unsupervised learning (only unlabeled examples, like data mining)
    Semi-Supervised (learner has access to labaled and unlabeled examples)
    Active learning (learner and teacher can interact with each other)
    Reinforcement learning (learner learns by interacting with the environment)


Online algorithms
    learner can access only one labeled instance at a time
        perceptron, winnow
Batch algorithms:
    learner can access the entire dataset
        naive bayes, svm, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees/nearest neighbors, boosting
Unsupervised/semi-Supervised algorithms
    expectation maximization
    k means


Representing data
    what is the best way to represent data for a particular task?
    the importance of the right features
    learning such features from data
    dimensionality reduction(time permitting)


Theory of Machine Learning - what does it mean to learn
    online learning - stop making mistakes or minimize regret in decisions as it continues
    probably approximately correct (PAC) after many examples, the learner will (with high probability) produce a function that makes small error
    Bayesian Learning - based on our observations, what is the probability distribution over possible functions that produced the data





This course focuses on the underlying concepts and algorithmic ideas in the field of ML
    A broad theoretical and practical understaning of maching learning paradigms and algorithms
    ability to implement learning algorithms
    identify where machine learning can be applied and make the most appropriate decision
