Sum of Products AB+BC
(sum of minterms) ABC + ABC' + A'BC
called "minterm" because when it is the expression there is ONLY 1 row in truth table whose result is 1

Product of Sums         (A+C')(B'+C )
(product of maxterms)   (A+B'+C)(...)
called "maxterm" because when it is the expression there is ONLY 1 row in truth table whose result is 0

\sum m(0,1,2) ... sum of midterm notation
\product M(0,2,3) ... product of maxterm notation




Boolean Algebra and Algebraic Simplification:

DeMorgan's Law
Z = XY -> Z' = X'+Y'
Z = X+Y -> Z' = X'Y'

F = ab+a'c
F' = (ab+a'c)' = (ab)'(a'c)' = (a'+b')((a')'+(c')=(a'+b')(a+c')

X+YZ = (X+Y)(X+Z) (duality - taking a true equation and replacing all + with *, 0 with 1,  and vice versa it is also true)
