*I should get a 3-ring binder for this class


e.g.  (gravitational potential energy) U = mgh

F_g = K_g (Mm)/(r^2), K_g is a constant to match units
and you can mention a direction unit vector

related: two charges, magnitude and direction of force exerted
F_e = K_e (Qq) / (r^2) * (vector)

Gravitational Field is value of F_g at each point in space

F_g / m = K_g M/(r^2)

so g has units of m/s/s because Newtons/kg = m/s/s



Electric Field
F_e / q = K_e Q/(r^2)
Newtons/Coulomb


VOLTAGE = \integral F_e dl
  = (Newtons/Coulomb) * (meters)
  =(Newton meters / Coulomb)
  = Joules/coulomb

CURRENT = Coulomb flow / second (charge/time)

Volts * Coulombs = 
(Newton*meter/coulomb)(coulomb/second) =
Newton*meter/second =
Joules / second
= 1 Watt

P=V*I
p(t) = v(t) i(t)

energy(t) = \integral p(t) dt
