Human Computer Interaction - Past Present Puture
	Elizabeth F. Churchill, Senion Director @ Google

HCI about having empathy and bringing technology to humanity





People thinnk oof personal devices, how computers show up in peoples lives/
Nicely designed interraactioon experiences - and work in the background to integrate/update

sustainability through maintainability - sociotechnical issues

currently working on new os - all parts are HCI (including battery lifeeee)



"aesthetically pleasing but also cognitively accessible"
 get graphic designers to talk to software engineers

"HCI is a discipline concerned with the design, implementation and evaluation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them"

*interaction* is nascent, not deep understanding

speculative design thinkinng - thinking about repair and redundancy
