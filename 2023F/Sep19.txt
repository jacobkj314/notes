Nate Presentation: "Explanations that Support Generalization"
	-modern models can produce an explanation alongisde the task prediction

	The portrait gallery experiment:
		predict whether a person is likely to make an optional donation when exiting a museum after visiting a portrait gallery
			explaining to the participants that exposure to faces/eyes . . . increases cooperative behavior -> increases likelihood that participants predict they will donate
			this was different when the same explanation was given about sculpture gardens

		so:
			explanation+portrait -> increase 
			explanation+sculpture -> increase if sculptures are of humans

	
	?Where else does the explanation to eyes

	are people more likely to donate after viewing : portrait gallery vs human sculpture vs abstract sculpture vs landscape paintings
	tv advertisement for a children's hospital that shows patients VS a news article with statistics about how many people died in a natural disaster

	Properties of Generalization
		Broad:
			New Questions shouldn't be about the same entities mentioned in the original question
			Can use part or all the knowledge from the explanation

	Joshi et.al. 2023 prompt davinci-instruct-beta

	Vivek:
		Khashabi 2017~2018 : "what season is it in New York in June" vs "what season is it in Sydney in December"
		Peter Clark

	!IDEA:
		combining  power sets of predicates

	Mattia:
		Peter Clark theory dataset *"RuleTaker", "Prover", "Entailment tree" Kaj 

	IDEA:
		train a model to not know anything but be able to perform inference

	IDEA: can you quantify what background knowledge a model is accessing
