A Learning-Based Perspective on Abstract Representations (Caleb Belth):


TODO:
	read Belth 2023 SCiL paper 



Rules and Representations

[b3d] 'bed' [b3d^n] 'beds'
but
[p3t] 'cap' [p3t^n] 'caps

so underlying category, with phonological rule for word-final devoicing

How to learn this meaning when /d/ can be [d] or [t]



ex

[dal lar], [jer ler], [buz lar], [s|oe|z ler]
could say AR of plural is /lar/


underlying Representations have been criticized as being wrong, redundant, indeterminate, ,insufficient, uninteresting (Hyman 2018 - trying to do justice to arguments against URs)
ex metal/medal BUT meTallic and meDallion (could mean underlying d/t)

resign re=sign but resignation, compare sign/signal
"As part of the abstractness debate of the 60s 70s, the question posed by lightner 1971 was where to stop
Hyman (2018): abstract URs are justified IF:
    -are not arbitrarily abstract
    -allow for parsimonious characterization of phenomena
    -do not lead to unintended side effects
    -capture speakers productive knowledge of phenomena

If acquisition is about discovering a target grammar, then
    abstract represenations are hidden structures that present an acquisition challenge
If acquisition is about becoming an effective language user, then   abstract represntations capture generalizations which can help a child deal with the sparsity of their input
(Today we look at this second perspective)

"How the input matters"
the character of the input ought to influence learner's represntations, but we need a theory of How
"Whence the underlying fofrms"
    other models assume urs and need better justification for them 

Some relevant empirical conditions of acquisition
proposed model
two case studies: systemic vowel harmony in turkish leads model to abstraction; generalization from surface faithful forms sufficient for dutch nouns


Children know much of their morphophonology by 3
They know a few hundred to a thousand words at this age
Most roots will only have a subset of forms attested in the input (Zipfian distribution)



The Learning Algorithm
InputL Morphologically Analyzed Surface Forms
Output: Uncerlying forms of each morpheme, Morphological rules, listed exceptional word forms, any phonological rules needed to map non-surface-faithful

Learning algorithm pseudocode::
While surface form in input do
	For morpheme in surface form do
		UR = morpheme most freqent form
		if "too much" alternation
			construct abstract UR
			learn phonological process
		else do
			lexicalize exceptions

"too much" alternation:
	measure with tolerance principle (Yang 2016)
	function of scope (n) #of things applied to and exceptions (e) 
	r is productive iff e <= n/ln(n)
		(derived from analytical zipfian distribution - grounded in same empirical conditions
Belth et al (2021) recursively subdivides until rules are productive -- to build a decision tree

WHy the tolerance principle?
	predicts exact point at which surface-faithful generalization fails
	derivation is cognitively motivated
	zipfian distribution necessitates generalizeation and yields threshold
	corpus, acquisition, computational and experimantal studies support it


Ran on CHILDES and MorphoChallenge datasets
	consistent results on both
	some constructed URs by the model:
		
	accuracy at predicting novel surface forms:


Turksihsh results:
	productive vowel harmony by 1K words in turkish
	consistent with Altan (2009)'s findings for kids (turkish paper)
	as the vocabulary increases

	
Dutch
	 traditional analysis would suggest that the devoicing rule would be treated as productive
	but that is not observed in children
	reversed wug
		These are slaDan (surface root: slaD)
		Point at the slaT
		vs
		These are keTen (keT)
		point at the keT
		
		If they can productively devoice the T, they should perform equally well, but the perform MUCH better for non-alternating nonces

Dutch has sg/pl and dim/non dim
dim pl is more frequent than pl in Child directed speech, which means you will have minmal evidence of the alternation

so
only some nouns take -^n instead of s
	only some of these nouns alternate
		only alternate in non-dim pl
Maybe Dutch learning children lack productive knowledge of voicing alternation because they lack evidence

looking at decision tree, there are enough exceptions to this "rule" in the very slim section where it appliesthat it seems like the rule is an excption


Result
Systemic character of Turkish vowel harmony leads to abstraction for some morphemes, but dutch voicing alternation form small enough corner  that they can be lexicalized





Future work:
what about adults? (CELEX - larger corpus)
alternation eventually prevalent enough? - under this model
Orthography? - singular form matches 

Comparative Study with German (Buckler & Fikkert 2016)
	german makes voicing distinction over larger range of obstruents, with substantially higher number of nouns alternate in German
