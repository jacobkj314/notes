Cladder: Assessing . . . 




Inverse scaling prize:
    find a task where larger models do worse:

            Redefinition task: 
                User: code blue means technical fault, not a medical emergency. What does code blue mean
                assistant: it means medical emergency

            Can be understood as competition between two mechanisms:
                1: memorization from taingin data 
                vas

                2. understanding the redefintion in the context

                THE LLM fails to understand which mechanism it should let win

Need to understand competitive mechanisms to prevent unwanted behavior

In Retrival Augmented Generation settings: the model must align with the provided context, 
in typical user interactions:the model should rectify incorrect information

    Tasks:
        redefinition
        repeated redefiniton

    
In redefinition task, you can look at each layer for the preojection to the unembedding to see which layer is involved in changing the expected token winning to the redefined token winning

Replace the altered token with tokens varyied in similarity to the recalled token
    measure the frequency of the winning mechanism across the dataset



The larger the model is, the stronger the memorization circuit is
