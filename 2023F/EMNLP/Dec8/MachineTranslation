Non Autoregressive Streaming Transformer for Simultaneous Translation

Read and Write simultaneously
balance between quality and latency
most existing models are autoregressive 

non monotonicity problem    
    some elements of the sentence can change order

Source info leakage bias
    due to teacher forcing

Non-autoregressive decoder helps to avoid anticipation and encourage the generation of monotonic generatin
