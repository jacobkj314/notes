Evaluating Neural Language Models as Cognitive Models of Language Acquisition
    Do LLMs induce human like syntactic represntations
    (more recently) Are LMs Human like models for language acquiestion

Behavioral Probes, templat-based eval
    generate from templates to get around sparsity
    but these can introduce datashortcutes

BLIMP Benchmark of Lingusitic minimal pairs
ZORRO - explicitly acquisition focused
    restricted child directed speech 
    released with BabyBerta

Observation:
    many test pairs are semantically odd or do not test grammaticallity at all

    infelicty, some patterns are BOTH grammatical, some dont actually test (eg. some anaphora is just memorization of associations between names and most common gender associated with it)

Solved ZORRO and BLIMP with 80-90% with linear-structure-based handcrafted rules
beat babyberta on 21/23 in zorro  and blimp
    Demonstrates that there aer shortcuts and syntactic representation is not needed for these

also 5-gram models

Proof of concept alternative:
    collection of sentences from "Lingusitic inquiry" and "core syntax" books

        comprehensive coverage of linguistic phenomena
        . . .


Trigram Model matches performance of models trained on a "developmentally plausible " amount of data

conclustion:
    template-based behavioral benchmarks have serious weaknesses
    success on these benchmarks tells us little about 











Cross-Lingual Data Augmentation for Thai Question Answering (Parinthapat Pengpun)

Motivation:
    develop a high performance robust qa model on thai (low-resource)

    mBERT has 30% lower on thai than english on XQUad

framework:
    generate more diverse data to improve robustness
    leverage machine translateion
    no augmentation pipetline requierd

monolinguiaal augmentations, plus use MT to translate and back, perform augmentations in high-resource lnaguage
Use LLM to perform grammar error correction on backtranslations


harmonic mean of og, augment !!!
