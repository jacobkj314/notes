Towards Explainable and Accessible AI (Brandon Duderstadt and Yuvanesh Anand)

Nomic
2019 RadAI - focus on data curation to outperform radiologists
. . . 
2023 GPT4All
    Pushback against closed science



GPT4All
GPT4 gives no detail about training

Stanford Alpaca:
    GPT Distillation
    Finetuned LLama 7B on davinci


OG GPT4All uses gpt-3.5 turbo, 1M seed prompts, Atlas (Nomic Platform), and LLama7B
Version 2 used GPT-J instead of LLama7B
GPT4all-snoozy
    scale up, use dolly dataset, llama13b

Integrated other models into the ecosystem (MPT, Wizard, Hermes)
Supplemented online presence with in person events (e.g. hackathon)
ship early + often based on community feedback
Ecosystem of tools
"Vulkan backend" - unclear what is this?

ATLAS
    atlas.nomic.com
    training data clustering and visualization

Make maps of the internet to search for "memetic warfare" - garbage generated content
