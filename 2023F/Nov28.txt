Ideas for making group meetings more interactive

-once a year, have something substantial to the group, but don't need to all present every semester
-you could decide to pick a topic that has sparked your interest and tell the group and prepare by reading or doing something

"learn just by being in the culture because people in the lab are talking about stuff"

Ashim: presenting ongoing research at meeting helps clarify/organize thoughts, has big impact on future work


hybrid option:
    have open sign up, but person in charge can monitor 3 weeks out and dynamically select presenters
finalize presenters 4wks out, finalize topic 2 weeks out


? how to engage more with students in other labs? - eg RL (Prof Brown) or HCI
    -casual event often so its ok if they miss


Oliver: Move to a tighter more conference like room
    -need projector/tv for presentations

-move couch in lab?
-move meetings into another room



Write 1 page max abstract/handout for others to read before the meeting
    -what others should know
    -request what questions/feedbacks you want


If we have an open "tea time"?
    -should have a topic / preereq paper/video
    Are other students interested in this?

Interdisciplinary Reading Group (occasional)

Implementation Walkthrough as a factor in reading groups
    - don't just have papers, also have tutorials
    ? every other reading group session

    -github

Spend first 15 minutes of group meetins to discuss recent events
If you are presenting, DON"T stand in front during this time
Discuss what you want - your work or something else - with a little heads-up to others

We will try to move the meeting to the lab or find a new conference room
Have group meeting as group meeting , but rebrand reading group as rg/town hall / coding session, etc; invite other labs to some sessions as well
Have contact to other labs (Brown, Ziad, Jeff, HCC) - we will talk about this  on this day, share with people from your lab if they want to join us
    -also use the department slack channel
